Brenda C,4 stars,5 months ago,"We liked the food at Mici. The food presentation is great. We ordered Green dragon roll, Steak and Prawn, Happy Family (shrimp, steak and scallop) and Scallop and prawns. See pictures below. The ambience is  relaxing. Our waitress was friendly. In the future, we may try some of their varieties of sushi."

Kathyria Burgos,3 stars,a year ago,"The sushi tasted great, price range is $$. Our only complaint was the serving size for the bbq boneless spare rib tips we ordered. 9$ for the portion we received was absolutely UNACCEPTABLE.
