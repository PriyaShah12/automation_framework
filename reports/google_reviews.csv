 Brenda C , 4 stars ,     2 months ago New  ,"We liked the food at Mici. The food presentation is great. We ordered Green dragon roll, Steak and Prawn, Happy Family (shrimp, steak and scallop) and Scallop and prawns. See pictures below. The ambience is  relaxing. Our waitress was friendly. In the future, we may try some of their varieties of sushi."

Felt like a robbery to pay that much and receive what looked like a kids portion."
